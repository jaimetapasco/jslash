# jslash
# The natural HTML5 evolution of Flash.

jslash is a microframework thougth with a simple purpose, 
fast game development for the Web client-side.

jslash uses the HTMLCanvasElement to draw the figures, and
provides a collection of objects to abstract the access to it.

jslash is developed in order to optimize the most current
operations of the developer, trying to always provide a 
built-in solution for a common problem on game development.
